# nc-convert

Converts netCDF to other formats

## Usage

Coming soon...

## Developing

Create a python environment using at least python 3.8, then install the development requirements:

```shell
pip install requirements-dev.txt
```

Run `make coverage` to generate a report of test coverage.

Releasing the package is as simple as creating a tagged release in GitHub. Make sure to create a new tag using `vX.Y.Z`
format, where `X` is the major version, `Y` is the minor version, and `Z` is the micro version. Set the release title
to `X.Y.Z`.
